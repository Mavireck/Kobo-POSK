# Kobo-POSK
A Python On-Screen-Keyboard for Kobo based on sherman's work in Go
https://github.com/shermp/go-osk

For a usage example, check the osk_test.py file, or the utils.py file which contain two useful functions:
mpopup and mprompt, which basically display popups or prompts that can be used like the input() function, except it is directly on the Kobo.
