# Kobo-POSK
A Python On-Screen-Keyboard for Kobo forked from sherman's work in Go. (except now it is in Python, and it is badly-coded)
https://github.com/shermp/go-osk

For a usage example, check the osk_test.py file, or the utils.py file which contain two useful functions:
mpopup and mprompt, which basically display popups or prompts that can be used like the input() function, except it is directly on the Kobo.

It relies on https://github.com/Mavireck/Kobo-Input-Python for input manipulation.
